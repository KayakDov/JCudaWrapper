/**
 * A utility class for managing a CUDA CUBLAS handle and a corresponding CUDA stream.
 * This class implements {@link AutoCloseable}, allowing for automatic resource management
 * when used in a try-with-resources statement. It handles the creation, association, 
 * and destruction of a {@link cublasHandle} and {@link cudaStream_t}, ensuring that 
 * resources are properly cleaned up.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * try (Handle handle = new Handle()) {
 *     // Use handle.get() to perform operations with the handle
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class registers the handle and stream with a {@link Cleaner} to ensure that 
 * both the CUBLAS handle and the CUDA stream are destroyed when the {@link close()} method 
 * is called, either explicitly or implicitly.
 * </p>
